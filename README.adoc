*emgr*, or Entity Manager, is a simple Lua library which implements a paradigm similar to **E**ntity **C**omponent **S**ystem (ECS).

The main difference with ECS is that the Component and System concepts are merged into the Manager.

== Concept

=== Entity

An entity is a table which is a set of managers defining a composition. It also has some methods and will free itself from managers on garbage collection.

Operations and data are not owned by an entity; its role is to bind managers to an object with automatic memory management.

=== Manager

A manager can be anything implementing the manager interface (methods). It defines and manages a component for the entities.

== API

[source, lua]
----
-- Create an entity.
emgr.entity()

-- Entity.

-- Initialize the entity into a manager.
-- Can be called even if already initialized.
entity:init(manager, ...)

-- Free the entity from a manager.
-- Can be called even if already freed.
entity:free(manager)

-- Check if the entity has a manager as composition (i.e. is managed by a manager).
-- Low-level alternative: check `entity[manager]`
entity:has(manager)

-- Manager interface, called by corresponding entity methods.

manager:init(entity, ...)
manager:free(entity)
